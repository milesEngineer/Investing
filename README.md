# Investing

Welcome to **Investing**, my private repository for centralizing all investment-related research, ideas, hypotheses, and notes. This repo serves as a personal hub to organize thoughts, track research, and potentially log trades.

The primary goals of this repository are:
- To store and organize research on various investment opportunities.

The repo is organized by **asset** (e.g., stocks, bonds, crypto), with subfolders for each specific asset (e.g., TSLA, BTC). Each asset folder contains categorized content such as theses, notes, articles, images, and significant events.
