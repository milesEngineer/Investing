LARGE SOL PERP RULES

- Only enter perp long when near 5% relative bottom or pre-halving rally or banana rally. Should be clear and obvious.
  - You still get to maximize upside without the fear or potential loss of liquidation.
- Set a 3% stop loss.
- If SOL is less than $160 and using 1000 SOL, set leverage to liquidation price of $100.
- If SOL is less than $140 and using 2000 SOL, set leverage to liquidation price of $95.
- If SOL is greater than $200 and using 2000 SOL, set leverage to 3.3x.
- If profit is greater than $225k, consider closing position or waiting for the election.

NOTES

- $110 is lowest price since halving
- If rally similar last year, than can hold for 3 months accumulating profit the whole way.
