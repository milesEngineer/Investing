# My Summary
- Big idea: Maximize the number of shares held (or buying power) between assets by swapping or pair trading based on relative values because assets can move at different times. 
- New investment strategy: Buy, hold, swap, and leverage high conviction assets to maximize wealth, health, and happiness.
- Rule: Only swap assets held < 1 year in tax-free account or if ratio is > x (TBD) and worth x (TBD) more than loss from taxes.
- Rule: Hold a minumum of 20% shares for each asset regardless of ratio
- Share Ratio = Price of Asset A / Price of Asset B
- Swap Checklist: 
- - Is the share ratio > x or < x?
- - Verify profit exceeds 37% STCG or 20% LTCG tax

- The big idea behind swapping is maximize buying power relative prospective assets.
- The most important is think in number of shares not asset price.
- The goal is maximize the number of shares
- Common fallacy: Wait for x asset to peak before rotating.
- MP: How do I maximize shares in context of taxes - wait for 1 year, only use tax-free account, synthetic longs?
- MP: Is there a minimum percentage of shares to hold of an asset?
- Hypothesis: "All assets move at different times, and can we capture the peaks and troughs?"
- MP: Minimizing taxes for assets held <1 year I should explore synthetic longs
- In video Jacob tradingview chart using bolliger bands, IA trend, mean reversion, and IA buy/sell signal.
- MP: Should you do predictive allocation based on upcoming narratives or reactive only?
- MP: What if I used a small percentage of portfolio to trade ultra high risk like meme coin with ultra low risk like gold? Undermines strategy as these are not assets I would want to own, only short term trades. However I could still use it trade TAO or NVDA or something else. Basically a small starting postition to acculate as TAO. 
- MP: This is idea could be powerful when applied to TAO's alpha tokens.
- MP: In comments someone has a minimum ratio of 1.4 for swapping. Could be good rule to have a minimum ratio.
- In comments for taxes, the trade has to be worth more than the loss from tax.
- MP: An options play is to sell covered call on one asset, and buy a call for the other asset. Hard part is time length.
- MP: Should have a layer approach to mitigate risk if a ratio delta continoues to increase. Remember IA multiple purchases of MSTR to TSLA after having held MSTR >2 years.
- MP: How to find an optimal asset to trade against (ie TAO)? IA says, "desynchronized assets"

# Grok Notes

- Use correlation coefficients (on tradingview) to measure historical correlation with a value close to 0 being uncorrelated
- "Pair a volatile tech asset (TAO) with a stable commodity (gold) or a dividend stock."
- If you can’t find a suitable long-term counter asset, or if potential pairs (e.g., TAO and another asset) are too closely correlated, you’ve suggested using a temporary uncorrelated asset for pair trading, even if it’s not something you’d hold long-term.
- Find an Optimal asset to trade against: What is TAO's price driver - BTC price, tech trend, narrative, etc? Screen for candidates from different sectors and different risk profiles using pair charts to confirm, set swap rules
- What is the best way to maximize shares for a pair trade in context of taxes - wait >1 year for 20% long term capital gains tax (LTCG), options strategy (sell covered call for one asset, buy call for another with premium), % allocation LTCG and STCG, or something else?
- "maintain at least 10-20% of your total position in each asset"..."If you have strong conviction in one asset, you might opt for a higher minimum (e.g., 20-30%) to ensure you benefit from its potential upside."

# Chat-GPT Notes
- reactive by default, predictive when conviction is high and signals align.
- Swap in tranches as the share ratio improves (e.g., at 1.2, 1.4, 1.6).
- rotate through a cluster of semi-correlated assets instead of a single one for broader flexibility


# Source Notes
Jacob teaches us timing on MSTR/TSLA pair trading and what factors to think about.

Here are the top rules we use

Core Philosophy: Maximize Buying Power, Not Price Gains

The central idea isn’t about selling at highs or buying at lows in dollar terms, but rather maximizing the number of shares (units) you can own through strategic swaps. As I say MSTR is my Currency....

This means:

Share ratio is king: Always ask, “How many shares of asset B can I get by selling one unit of asset A?”

Forget the all-time high myth or the Dollar value: Waiting for an asset to reach a new high before swapping often reduces buying power if the target asset also appreciates simultaneously.

When to Swap: The Share Ratio Framework
Here’s how to detect ideal swap conditions using relative strength and share ratio analysis:

Use the Share Ratio Formula:
Share Ratio=Price of Asset A/Price of Asset B

When this ratio is rising, Asset A is gaining strength relative to Asset B.

Ideal time to sell Asset A (the strong horse) and buy Asset B (the weak horse).

Best-Case Scenarios to Swap:
Asset A (current holding) goes up, Asset B goes down: Ratio spikes.

Asset A stays flat, Asset B declines: Still an improved ratio.

Both fall, but Asset A falls less: Maintains superior ratio.

Both rise, but Asset A rises more: Again, ratio improves.

Goal: Enter when you can buy more units of the second asset than you previously could—ride the faster horse, then swap to the slower one before it catches up.

Avoid This Common Mistake

“I’ll wait for MSTR to peak before buying TSLA.”

Reading the Pair Chart: The Trader’s Radar
Use a pair chart (MSTR/TSLA or vice versa):

Watch for trend changes, confluence zones, and buy/sell signals on IADSS.

Look for divergence between asset performance:

E.g. MSTR flat while TSLA crashes → ratio spikes → swap into TSLA.

E.g. MSTR dips while TSLA pumps → ratio bottoms → swap into MSTR.

🔍 Example Case Study: Tesla vs. MicroStrategy

Event: Tesla dropped due to Elon/Trump controversy while MSTR remained flat.

Result: MSTR/TSLA ratio peaked → ideal to rotate into Tesla.

Follow-up: TSLA recovered; MSTR dipped → ratio bottomed → ideal to rotate back into MSTR.

Conclusion: The pair chart captures these divergences before the individual charts might confirm.

Macro + TA Combo: As I say always keep your head out the window

MSTR Macro catalysts:

e.g. MicroStrategy inclusion in the S&P 500

e.g. BTC breaking resistance

Technical signals:

Optimized trend flips (e.g. orange → blue = trend change)

Support/resistance levels

Moving averages (especially 200-day)

Gaps in price action

Checklist for Expert Swaps

Check the share ratio (A/B) — is it peaking or bottoming?

Confirm with the pair chart — any buy/sell signals?

Analyze individual trends — is one asset trending while the other isn’t?

Factor in macro events — upcoming news that might affect the assets differently?

Be dynamic — don’t marry your asset; marry the buying power strategy.

Advanced Notes for the Elite Swapper

Use confluence bands and hourly/daily pair chart overlays.

Watch for "relative outperformance" over short windows.

Rotation model: Not just for MSTR/TSLA—apply to IBIT, BTC, or other correlated but desynchronized assets.

Mental model: Think like a value hunter in share terms, not just a price chaser.

Final Wisdom

“The pair chart tells the story underneath… Follow the signals.”

The magic isn't in finding the perfect top or bottom—it's in being directionally correct and compounding share count across cycles of volatility. This is how James turned $200K into $1M—through repeatable asymmetric swaps, not brute leverage or guessing price tops.
