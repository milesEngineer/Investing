**DECISION: Sell All SOL** - Given the risk to reward ratio of SOL vs TSLA over the bear market, I think TSLA is the best choice given my current state. If I was already at or near my 1% goal, then holding SOL would make more sense.

Does selling all of my SOL get me closer to my goal of being in the top 1% of wealth in the world or $15 million in five years?

- Tesla and bitcoin seem like a buy and hold for a decade the remaining crypto seem more like consensus trades.
- The original big idea of selling crypto for TSLA was to park my money in a safer asset after I’ve reached retirement. Then re-invest next cycle.

**Pros**:

- **No Market Timing**: Raul Paul said he’s going to hold most of his Solana because looking at BTC most people would be better off holding rather than trying to time the market cycles.
- **7% Staking**: I can stake SOL to offset inflation.
- **Perp Long**: I can continue trading perpetual longs with SOL.
- **$11.5k Tax Saving**: I can hold onto my short-term capital gains Solana to save $11,500 in taxes.
- **No More SOL Allocation**: I don’t need to buy any Solana for next cycle
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Holding mostly Tesla and bitcoin and Solana.

**Cons**:

- **6.5% Solana Inflation**: If SOL continues typical market downward trend, this could extenuate losses.
- **Grayscale SOL ETF Dump**: If SOL gets an ETF, the market will likely take longer than six months to remove all of grayscale outflows.
- **Slower Horse**: Small probability that SOL will outperform Tesla until start of next crypto cycle, even with ETF.
- **SOL Alt Killer**: Similar to ETH last cycle, there could be another L1 next cycle that is faster, cheaper, and greater network adoption.
- **Unknown Consensus Trade**: Way too early to tell what the consensus trade is for next cycle. It probably won’t be Solana two cycles in a row. It could be RWA instead of L1’s like Pyth.
- **Potential** **OverTrade**: Having the optionality to perp long while full time investing/trading could lead to increased trading if not disciplined. Also the ability to perp long while the market is trending downward will increase the probability of losing.
- **No Useful Loan**: Taking a loan from [Solend.fi](http://Solend.fi "‌") for SOL yields more SOL, thus to sell that SOL creates taxes.
