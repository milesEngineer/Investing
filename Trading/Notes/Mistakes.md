1000 SOL Perp Mistake 

How did I get here?

- not following the tools I paid for
- taking out too much leverage 5x
- listening to bullish sentiments from crypto influencers
- not setting a stoploss via a trade alert
- too large a position size

The one thing that would have prevented the trade would have been waiting for IADSS signal. The second thing upon entering the trade would have been to set a stop loss via trade alert.
Need a physical print of perp rules for discipline

**1000 SOL Perp**

- The main benefit adding 2000 SOL as collateral is increasing the probability of not losing my 1000 SOL, but at the cost of potentially liquidating my entire portfolio. If liquidated, this would set me back nearly 4 years of work… all for nothing.
- I could salvage losing 1000 SOL by working until SOL hits $330 & $9 WIF for $750k. Well short of my goal, but still respectable and able to quit my job. Though very risky, I could also do a 2000 SOL perp at 3.3x near $110. A $50 gain would be $330k pre-tax, allowing me to recover 1000 SOL.
- I could sell right now and guarantee 400 SOL back around $134. Right now it would be painful, but 400 is a lot better than 0.
- TO DO: Math on 200 Short/Perp Long on scalping to salvage situation. 3% trade alert stop loss.
- possible rule: at or below support line and OT 4H trend flips

PATH OF FUCKING MISTAKES

1. $100,000 loan to buy ETH at last bull cycle top (& incuring high Coinbase fee's)
   1. Avoid: For loans, only do with confirmation of macro technical indicators.
   2. Avoid: Only use Coinbase Advanced or DEX for token purchases.
2. Sell ETH for LSD's after >50% down (& high rETH fee's)
3. Not buying BTC during bear low
   1. Avoid: DCA using technical analysis
4. Rotating from ETH LSD's missing 45 day run to flatline OP (& incurring high Coinbase fee's)
5. Buying WHALES on local top and missing NOS 5x
6. Buying NOS at local top (& JUP fee's)
7. Rotating to SOLCHAT on impulse moving market cap a few percent and losing $20k
8. Not buying PYTH or JUP when low
9. Buying WIF at local top $2.10, holding through $1.7 drawdown, up to $3.60, selling at $2.10 to buy back at $2.44.
   1. Avoid: Releaize the difference between trades and investments. For trades, take profit when over valued and re-buy when under valued. Use TA.
10. Not selling WIF pre halving to buy in later
11. Not selling WIF at 2.50 after telling myself I would sell it based on upcoming market activity. I think going on vacation next day negatively affected this decision because I didn’t want to worry about buying back into WIF or fomo’ing. I even calculated buying at $1.75 with my original capital.
    1. 8 days later, down nearly 50% from buy price. I need to know the difference between trades and investments. WIF was a trade, and I need to take profit and loses accordingly. Now I am stuck holding between holding a bag hoping it will make it back to $10 by end of year.
12. Taking leverage on SOL during vacation. No upcoming catalysts, incorrect borrow fee calculation, no technical analysis. Bought at $136.84 and sold at $128.05 for a loss of $28,898.37 or 186 SOL. 16 hours later from when I sold, I was >$139, so I would have made money. Instead I lost $29k.
13. Selling 1000 SOL perp long to early on July 13th and not getting back in after realizing mistake. Would have made about $70k, instead I made $2k. I thought the assassination attempt was a short term play, and forgot that I had a good low entry price of $138. Instead I was freaked out by not getting out early enough the prior week.
14. Fucking bought a SOL perp short with 1000 SOL on an impulse. Proceeded to immediately lose 10 SOL and the kicker…. lose my long term capitals for November because it can only convert to a Tether!!!! FUCK!!!! I can not do shorts or at least with much money because it goes against my long term belief in the token.
