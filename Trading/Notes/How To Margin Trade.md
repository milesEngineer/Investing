James of Invest Answers Recommendations

- Set Leverage to 3.3x, no more than 5x
  - 8 min [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kq-GrDvJJE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kq-GrDvJJE "smartCard-inline")
- Have huge buffer
- Every 70 SOL made 100 SOL for 4 weeks and 3 days after fees
- Liquidation Levels at 94-98
- Don't be in leverage for more than 10 - 30 days, 50% margin at 6% for a year is fine though
- Goal is to take profit 25-30% every 10 - 30 days using tools. For SOL like the 2 H with IA-PTOS-Model and OT.
- Once a perp is above 30% or your target then, set your stop loss at that mark.
- Use trade alarms instead of stop loss: “no i do not as I watch the markets 24/7 and have alarms... using Stop losses in Crypto is like going into a prison and say, please rape me. sorry about the crude analogy but the market makers can see your stop losses and they just go fishing for them.”

How to Margin Trade on IA-Trend-Model

- Avoid false breakouts: Wait for the candle to close above/below the signal line before taking action.
- IA: “Once you hit your 4 hr signal, then use the lower time zones to drill into a target you like.”
- IA: “Wait for this sequence: First you confluence, second mean reversion, and third trend to flip.”
- IA: “Paper trade for 2-4 weeks”
- [Mynewego](https://discord.com/channels/804476297903997001/876198905145065532/1264048021402816562 "‌") on discord says he exits 50% of position after a significant profit because fees are cheaper, and your playing with house money now.

NOTES

- 48 hrs before Trump speaks at Bitcoin conference markets start moving up from local bottom. Is this a global pattern?
- 200 SMA is medium term support
- Death Cross and Golden Cross is 50 day and 200 day SMA crossing
- 3 models at 80% win rate is equivalent to 95% win rate
- In order to prevent "repainting" or false breakouts, we need to wait for the time bar to close that contains the crossing trend lines. Historically using "Bar Open" performs better, however we should actually set order trigger to "Bar Close" for a more accurate real time performance.
- Scott: In and out of trade in less than 30 min to the first hour of exchange opening using the 1 min chart and confluence model.IA: IADSS is optimized for 4 hr time frame.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrsNzBzESg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrsNzBzESg "smartCard-inline")
- Mr. Dip: swing trading on the 4 hr chart. “The more time you have, the more accurate and precise you can be.” “Its about laying traps and sniping levels.” “AI and bots will push traders to 4 hr and 1 day” “Arbitrage will be the first thing to go”  [https://www.youtube.com/live/5UNTi1qwOo0](https://www.youtube.com/live/5UNTi1qwOo0 "smartCard-inline")
- Rick: IA’s favorite time frame is 6 - 12 weeks because the more time you weave into your equation the higher probability of success. The money is in selling the options. Rick uses 3 models except optimized trend instead. Waits for Confluence & trend signals, and mean reverted (but doesn't have to be signal) before action. New traders need to learn to “double tap in” and “double tap out”. IA uses settings set to default settings, tight bands, everything neutral. You can trade on optimized trade alone if your using the right time frame.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X7xnj-EDc4&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X7xnj-EDc4&feature=youtu.be "smartCard-inline")
- Graceson: engineers make good investors. Trading options is a much better way to control risk. OT is better for longer term trends (2h/4H), but for more precise trades use static trends. Buying leaps and selling short term calls against those leaps is a covered call on steroids and a perpetual money maker. Buy assets that appreciate.
- Gitt: Wait for the 2 standard deviation from the mean to buy on the 4 H, then use lower time frame for exact buy price. I do 80% of my trade right before close of stock market, but for crypt its either weeknends or Monday. Uses Case-Schiller method to buy houses and waits for dips to buy a house. Then buys distressed multi-unit properties (typically 4 units). “The way you make money in real estate is by fixing other peoples problems.” Buy close to amenities and in a city thats growing in population. Usually have to put 10%-15% of the propertys value in fixing it up. Real estate is get rich slow. Must be within a 3 hr driving distance because tesla autopilot can help drive through the night. Use redfin and zillow to find homes. been sitting on market for > 45 days and discover why its not selling. Trailor parks cash flow the best but are hard to manage.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34PYmciC8mM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34PYmciC8mM "smartCard-inline")
- Using GATEIO exchange for SOL3xLong is different than perp long. Mr Dip says you want to use IADSS for SOL perp, but only 10% are profitable.
- Q&A on 8/28/24 30 min: James uses PTOS model for SOL perp trades. The most important thing now that we’re in the banana zone is waiting for the trend to turn to get out of it and not getting out too early. That’s the most important thing I’ll say thing whole video.
- Later in video: If you want to sit at home and trade all day to build your bag as fast as possible I would do PTOS. if I had to trade one to three times a week I would do a ATR.
- MP: What if I look for secondary indicator to bar open on trend?

4 Hr Sol Notes

- 6/9/24: Only waiting for 4 hr optimized trend prevented a bag buy signal on 6/9/24 despite confluence, mean reversion and trend all in agreement. The daily trend showed orange/no buy, while the optimized trend showed blue/buy.
