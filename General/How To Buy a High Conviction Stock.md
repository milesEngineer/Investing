## How to Buy a High Conviction Stock
The big idea is to sell puts to get paid to wait for your ideal buy price, using the premium to earn interest. (Following was by ChatGPT)

1. Find a wonderful business. Do your valuation work and decide its intrinsic value and a “margin-of-safety” buy price.

2. Pick your buy price (the strike). Choose a strike at or below the price you’d be thrilled to own the stock.

3. Commit cash, not leverage. Set aside enough cash/T-bills to buy 100 shares per contract at the strike (cash-secured, not naked).

4. Choose an expiration. Favor a calm window (often 1–6 months out) where the premium fairly compensates you for waiting.

5. Size conservatively. Limit contracts so an assignment won’t crowd your liquidity or concentration limits.

6. Place a limit order to sell the put. Sell the cash-secured put at your strike/expiry; use a limit price that reflects fair value for the risk.

7. Collect premium and park collateral. The option premium is yours today; keep the collateral in safe, interest-earning instruments.

8. Monitor the business, not the tape. Only re-underwrite if fundamentals change; volatility alone isn’t a thesis.

9. If the option expires worthless. Stock stays above the strike, you keep the premium—your “paid to wait” outcome; you can repeat.

10. If you’re assigned. You buy at the strike; effective cost basis = strike − premium received, ideally below intrinsic value.

11. Become an owner. Hold patiently while the business compounds; consider covered calls only if you’re happy to part with shares.

12. Review risks and taxes. Know early-assignment/dividend timing, avoid margin, and track tax treatment of option premium and basis.
