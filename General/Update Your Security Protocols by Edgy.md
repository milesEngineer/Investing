It would be best if you also took this as an opportunity to upgrade your security protocols. I like the Three Address Protocol (TAP) from @‌punk6529.

#1 Vault addresses: You only use this for cold storage. All your high-value investments go here. The only thing you do is transfer assets in and out. Nothing else. Ideally, these should be hardware wallets.

Since there won’t be any dApp interaction, this address would’ve escaped the Ledger hack.

#2 Transaction addresses: This is where you store your more active assets. LP positions, yield farming, and usage of relatively secure protocols happen through this. These can be hardware wallets as well.

#3 Burner addresses: These are the addresses you use whenever you do anything remotely risky. Saw an interesting link from Discord? Create a burner address before connecting to it. It should be a habit.

​Delegate.xyz is a tool that’ll help you delegate the rights (airdrop claim, exclusive access, etc.) of your transaction & vault addresses to burner addresses. However, it isn’t available for all apps.

If you use this protocol, you should be safe from phishing attacks. Tools like Fire, Wallet Guard, and Pocket Universe will also alert and protect you from phishing attacks. Even with all those tools, you can fall into traps.

That’s why you should create an escape hatch as well.

If you suspect something fishy might be going on with any of your wallets, there should be a single button you can click to transfer all your valuables into a new uncontaminated wallet. Webacy helps you create such a system.

Finally, I stopped using Metamask earlier this year and switched over to Rabby. There are a ton more safeguards in place with Rabby.
