Here are 10 other tips to be aware of when investing. Remember: it takes a lifetime to make it and a second to lose it. 
Leverage Amplifies Losses: Even small market movements can result in significant losses when using high leverage, as losses are magnified relative to your actual investment.
Set Strict Rules and Limits: It's essential to have clear rules on how much you're willing to risk and to stick to these limits to prevent catastrophic losses. I only risk 1% in Perps of my SOL Bag, often times a lot less. 
Understand Liquidation Risks: Know your liquidation levels and ensure they are well below current price levels to give yourself a cushion against market volatility. Be prepared to add collateral if required. Always have the SAFETY MATTRESS on hand like having cash on hand for that rainy day. 
Emotional Discipline is Key: Trading with leverage can be stressful and requires keeping emotions like greed and fear in check to avoid rash decisions.
Market Manipulation and External Events: Be aware that markets can be manipulated or extremely affected by unpredictable events, which can be disastrous when using leverage. Eg Massive Wicks way beyond price levels on certain exchanges, eg Binance... they wick this for a reason to GRAB YOUR BAGS - remember that.
Regularly Reassess and Learn: Constantly review your strategies and learn from both successes and failures. Sharing experiences, as seen in these forum posts, can be an invaluable learning tool. NEVER MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE
Diversification is Critical: Avoid concentrating too much risk in a single asset or strategy, especially when using leverage. I never go above 1% into Perps - REMINDER
Beware of Overconfidence: Successful trades can lead to overconfidence, which may result in taking on excessive risk. The Minute you get cocky - the markets will RIP your face off!
The Importance of Exit Strategies: Always have a clear exit strategy and use tools like stop losses to limit potential losses, despite their own risks. Know Your Exit Before You enter - I choose Layers for a Reason... it is not by chance.
Educate Yourself Continuously: Understanding market cycles, recognizing signs of volatility, and staying informed about economic indicators can better equip traders to use leverage wisely.
