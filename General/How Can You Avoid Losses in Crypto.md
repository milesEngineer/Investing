How Can you Avoid Losses in Crypto?
Charlie Munger is known for promoting a technique called “Inversion”. It involves thinking about what you want to avoid and not doing anything that may cause it.

Right now, I'm trying to improve my sleep. So, I'll ask myself, what will screw up my sleep?
​
Drinking alcohol, using my phone before going to bed, and not getting sunlight in the morning. Now that I've identified these issues, I can simply avoid them.
​
So here are some common mistakes I see in Crypto.

​

Waiting to "Break Even" Before Cutting Losses:

Many wait until their investment breaks even before cutting their losses.

​

However, this is a psychological error. It assumes that the market cares about the price at which you entered. Of course, the market doesn’t care about your buying price at all. Also, you have to realize the opportunity cost. Even though you're down 30%, the remainder could be better used elsewhere.

​

Following Other People's Calls:

Everyone goes through different levels of this. The first one is following the idiot shillers on YouTube and Twitter. You get wrecked and learn from it.
​
The second level is when you follow people who are "gigabrains." Oh man this guy went to Standard and works for this VC! Becareful of the Halo effect and the authority bias.
​

The right way to use an influencer call is as a signal for further research. Then you need to develop a thesis for your potential investment.

​

Not Taking Profits:

Degens often gets greedy when it comes to taking profits.

​
The thrill of making money can cloud judgment. Even if a token 3x, many won’t take any profits. They believe that the token will do another 10x. And once the token falls 90%, they end up losing all of those gains.

​
The key to overcoming this is establishing a profit-taking system that operates independently of emotions. For example, you always take out your principal investment after the first 2x return. You take 25% out after another 2x. And so on.

​

This systematic approach removes emotions from the equation. And it will help you to secure profits.

​

Overtrading:

I used to play poker for fun. One mistake I made was the action bias. Basically, I'd get so bored waiting for a good starting hand, that I'd played garbage hands because I wanted some action.
​
Patience is an advantage here. There are a few times each year where the market's on "easy mode." Guys screw up because they lose everything trying to trade choppy markets. No trade is a trade.

​

Leverage Trading:

Leverage trading is like speeding in a sportscar — it might get you to your destination faster, but on the way, the slightest mistake might kill you.
​

While leverage trading can magnify gains, it also amplifies losses. Many people have wiped out their entire portfolio through leverage trading.
​

The advice here is straightforward: stick to spot trading unless you're entirely confident in your understanding of leverage. Leverage should only ever be used cautiously and only by those who fully understand it.

​

Avoiding stupidity is more important than seeking brilliance. All of the above are stupid ways to lose money. And since crypto has great potential, if you can avoid losing money, you’ll be able to make a lot more in the long run.
