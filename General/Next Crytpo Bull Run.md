PART 1


- Pair trade DOGE and BTC or their proxies. Can also use as indicators as start of “alt season”
- “The token is the product, not the software… Every cycle, the cryptoassest category that outperforms the most is one that is ‘new, weird, and misunderstood.’” ~ Murad

- MartyParty: Bitcoin trends on google (can compare to porn) signal we’re entering the distribution of Wycoff, then tv commercials, retail FOMO. IA says retail can’t move BTC’s market cap. Only ETF, sovereigns, pensions, and more institutional treasury adoption. Only big retail like billionaires. Google needle doesn’t matter for price. Retail can move memes.
- S&P500 < Bitcoin < Doge / Microstrategy
- CRO looks like a runner every cycle
- Looks like the market cap was more accurate for support and resistance on SOL after halving than price
- French whale wins $50 M by hiring his own pollers with his own method to bet against biased media polls. I could do something similar for other bets by paying to acquire private data for an advantage.[https://newsletter.luckytrader.com/p/polymarkets-50m-trump-whale-reveals](https://newsletter.luckytrader.com/p/polymarkets-50m-trump-whale-reveals "smartCard-inline")
- next election recognize that you correctly predicted the day before the election on Monday as the low due to market uncertainty, and then utilize the polls and prediction markets and aggregate to place a bet at that low, knowing that you can set a stop loss when the price rises. Also remember that the price of bitcoin mirrored poly market, and Pennsylvania odds of Trump winning.
- Small percentage for prediction markets on high win rate and minimal effort. Goal of making 10% a day, by compounding gains on “sure” bets.
- Ben Cowen strategy is the easy strategy of buying BTC in bear and holding until 60% Market Dominance, then shifting into alts. Not worth it to him to chase alts.
- half of the cycle will start offloading bitcoin when it reaches 60% market dominance
- Infinite Money Glitch
  - Loan at 5% Interest, Invest in SOL and stake at 7%, Sell unstake and sell SOL as needed to payoff loan
- Compounding perps/dynamic scaling

- Long and short at macro support in resistance until fundamental changes in into money supply or Q4
- A Google Sheet to log each transaction, portfolio, goals, calculators,etc.
- Invest Answers uses Coinbase Active Trading platform to avoid fees - “they’re negligible”.
- Explore DCA out - Layer in layer out model. Invest Answers like selling things in fifths or 20% of your bag or 20% of your position.
- A personal dashboard to view all important metrics.
- Learn basic technical analysis “because it’s about what the big players are actually doing, not saying.”
- Avoid exchange & bank dependencies: SoFi ACH transfer issue prevented buying. Unable to send outgoing wire transfer from SoFi.
- Average Token Price: Always know for each token
- 5-6 tokens for next cycle?
- what ROI am I seeking for each investment? invest answers wants at least a 3x
- diversify to maintain wealth into crypto blue chips (BTC, ETH, SOL, LINK)
- don’t try to time tops and bottoms. DCA, 200 day moving average, or some other non-emotional metric
- Defi Edgy: I like investing in the market leader, and a slightly different beta play.
- Hold 20-30% cash by selling a portion of tokens when cash holdings is getting low or token is over bought. Allows to readily buy.
- bollinger band indicator for when to buy and sell BTC
- Invest Answer recommends having a uni key for Coinbase account, and white list all your addresses.
- Invest Answers says Saylor uses OTC to buy BTC, not exchange.
- MP Observation: Seems like most alt-coin trades are simply finding the consensus and/or narrative trade, then finding the fastest horse in that ecosystem. For example, Bitcoin ETF with ORDI or SATS. Or SOL as consensus trade with BONK. (All these trades went from 1000-2000% in 90 days at start of the bull.)
- DeFi Edgy: Three Underrated Ways to Master DeFi: Reading Governance Forums from protocols and DOA’s, reading old books like Market Wizards and Trading In The Zone, Using Burner Wallets to Experiment with dApps like $100 a walet
- Raul: don’t fuck this up. Your job is to buy and hold until ideally the end of 2025 and have all your tokens that you started with. Don’t do yield farming. Don’t take leverage. Don’t FOMO. If there’s a 20% sell off then buy. Keep it simple. Keep it calm.
- securely store hardware wallet seed by digitally hiding the algorithm and encrypt the seed on the metal recovery plate. Makes it impossible for someone to access both physical and digital spaces.
- InvestNaswers: when there is a big psychological price like $200 it’s best to target below that because most people start to sell before reaching it.
- MP: My investment strategy is identifying consensus trades early, ideally, before start of bull run, then putting in 60-80% portfolio. I need to identify my niche strategy for remaining portion like AI + 1 - 3 month trades, mirroring on-chain whales/successful accounts, etc.
- Edgy “Monitoring stablecoin inflow is an excellent indicator for gauging which chains are becoming hot. If you’d observed the increasing Solana stablecoin volume in October [2023], you could’ve joined the Solana hype in November [2023].”
- Coin Bureau: BRC-20 tokens involving lending and borrowing should do well this cycle.
- For a limited period of time go offshore or overseas to take 0.5 or 1X leverage on a portion of a relatively safe allocation like a blue chip or consensus trade.
- IA holds 80% and trades 20%. Practice paper trading first because  investing is a blood sport. everyone wants to rips your head off. Lol invest in your financial education because the field is constantly evolving. Know markets deeply, technical analysis, macroeconomic trends, how to build financial models, plan, improve your investment processes.
- MP: Putting $20k on $WHALES, then seeing it drop 30% within a day isn’t a good feeling. I feel scared that I may be “rugged” because the founders are anonymous. No more tokens with anon founders. Also my timing has been historically bad with all purchases except SOL. I need a data driven way to un-emotionally buy. Also 1 week after choosing $WHALES over $NOS, $NOS is up >100% and $WHALES is down <20%. I didn’t choose $NOS because higher market cap and no evidence of usage. I didn’t think narrative was as important as proven value. It’s still only 1 week out, so $WHALES could still pump.
- Ark Invest: S-curves reach tipping points when the adoption of new technologies approaches 10-20% market share. (2024 Big Idea paper)
- Crypto Billionare: “If the best case scenario is 100x and the worst case scenario is losing 100%, its a very asymetic bet.” He was referring to Bitcoin advice to buy and hold. However you could go farther down the risk with tokens that can realistically hit 100x possibly previous cycle’s meme coins.
- Meme coins, do you want to be right (they no utility) or do you want to make money. They’re internet culture.
- MP: 1st rally narrative Bitcoin ETF with L1’s taking off, 2nd rally Bitcoin ETF approved and  halving near with meme coins
- MP: the secret to me being calm is having a good entry price or long timeline. I have horrible “instinct” for timing. I must buy before cycle or use some metric to tell me to buy in the cycle.
- Idea: Buy both meme coins for upcoming presidential election.
- consider studying Feb 26 2024 when meme coins took off and the markets in general saw big inflows.
- Chart a timeline of WIF and previous meme cycle winners like token launch, CoinMarketCap listing, first influencer mention, etc.
- Guy uses Google to track hail damage and place leveraged bet. Wall Street doesn’t like interpretable data like Yotuhe comments, Twitter because they’re analytical. He Reads every comment and talks to people at companies that know. He calls it observational trading/social arbitrage trader and only does 3 big trades a year. You have to do the work and wait for the right time. Don’t force the trade. He does Jack Schager in market wizards. He doesn’t trade price but information. When the info is out to the world, that’s when he gets out. Buy when there’s an imbalance of information.
- MP: I fucked up again. Nailed selling WIF at the bottom after 3 days of decline. Broke even at $2.10, bought back 9,000 less WIF and at 2.43. Lesson “dont be cute”. I already sat through to a $1.7 drawdown, then I impulse sell at $2.1 because BTC/SOL on the hourly we’re still dipping. Really dumb considering I already knew I picked a winner. And if I was going to sell, I should have at the top. Going back in time I would have just held through the whole thing. I can’t predict tops or bottoms. I haven’t made any fucking money with this ETH money over the last few years.
- MP: the realization that I need something to analyze real time price movements and why they’re happening. And whether or not to buy, hold or sell.
- InvestAnswers: NEVER lending more than 10% of your cryptocurrency holdings. Both rehypothecation and lending entail considerable risk.
- a dedicated device for financial portfolio or access to trading accounts. Never WiFi, only Ethernet.
- InvestAnswers uses many validators on stakewiz for sol staking - combo of high stake amount, good reviews, low commissions, good return
- InvestAnswers: March 24, 2024 live q&a 26 min mark for how he exactly times the bottom of JUP. 2 indicators: checked every couple hours for a month. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifsf9YVS68](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qifsf9YVS68 "smartCard-inline")  Used IADSS on a 2 hr.
- InvestAnswers: IBIT in fidelity to hold bitcoin for heirs
- IA: once you have money for life buy assets that generate perpetual income. He does this for sport.
- MP: I would like to do pair trading. Seems simple and lucrative.
- IA: keeps his money in a money market account called JLP or Jupiter perpetual liquidity fund. You get 100% a year. People use your liquidity to trade. You have to know where the yield comes from. And you should get out when the market gets “hot”.
- MP: How to capture the volatility of meme coins? Selling at local tops and buying at local bottoms.
- MP: My barbell strategy is Bitcoin and consensus trade, 1 newly created meme in year before bull market, 1 new meme on consensus  L1, top narrative token
- IA: has double the expected taxes ready to pay to the IRS
- IA: 80% long term holds, 20% trades on those long term holds
- IA: Recommends looking at his older videos to non-KYC your crypto, but you should be able to use Bitcoin ATMs or jump through hoops.
- MP: IA admitted he was distracted and didn’t sell BTC and SOL at top with chart indicators. It seems to me these buy/sell signals are a source of truth, all other data is secondary.
- Raoul Pal - Strategy: invests mostly in the bear, and only buys during dips of bull market, doesnt sell
- for meme coins I need to check whales per coin.
- MP: Consider investing $1,000 or small amount of money in sleeper coins like GME who rose over >2,250% in 2 days from RoaringKitty tweeting a locked in meme, who had been silent for a long time.
- Instead of buying BTC, ETH, or SOL on spot, buy at least a portion from Jupitors JLP pool and earn around 75% APY.
- missed leveraging announcement of ETH ETF. If I put 1000 SOL for $15 gain I would have made >$300k.
- I could simply take out a leverage bet when I place a new trade at the bottom of the market. Additionally if I don’t cash out, then I can open up leverage against my current investment for more of the same time.  Ex. SOL to buy more SOL
- MP: About 6 - 9 months before halving, pay for X, DM meme influencer like blograze or Mando for a hour paid session of insights like chats to be in, who to follow, etc
- Store safe in the backyard underground
- **How Raul P choose SOL this cycle?** 1. Checked for superior network effects. 2. Checked different crosses: BTC/ETH, ETH/SOL to see which one rises the fastest out of the ashes. And saw SOL was breaking out. Started buying June '22 and went max long as they went.

- IA “Miners know whats going on better than anybody. They literally have their finger on the pulse of whats happening in the market. They are waiting for higher prices, you should too.” MP: Miners have a direct correlation and incentize to sell at the top of each cycle. Follow the miners for cycle tops. This chart seems incredible important made by CG Julio at [https://cryptoquant.com/community/dashboard/63064a8d77d099261f5ddfb8](https://cryptoquant.com/community/dashboard/63064a8d77d099261f5ddfb8 "‌"). COnfirmed by this its here, but I dont think I can see it because i need to upgrade to $29/month for charts.
- Mando uses feel for market top and believes that you can get caught out of position using technical analysis
- MP: Follow people with notifications who tweet and move markets with money ready to immediately redeploy into token.
- IA: In advent of AI in trading, IA recommends swing trading on a 6 - 12 week time frame for 20% of your bag and investing the other 80%.
- MP: after the fed meeting minutes of hawkish outlook on 6/10/24, I saw the market would continue sideways with a good chance to break to the downside below my WIF entry. And I waited until Friday morning at 9am to hear Mandi’s thoughts when he already spoke about it for 2 days. During that time, WIF dropped over 5% and continued to fall.
- IA: In a bull market, the short term holder realized price if the floor. If it were, it would break history.
- IA: recommends 30 - 40% surplus capital to add to a leverage long position in case liquidation event nears
- IA: is never under 7% cash unless there is a pico bottom [absolute lowest bottom] and he will blow it all.
- IA: You can make a really good living just by pair trading BTC & TSLA, weekly and monthly trade.
  \-MP: good idea is to you find the top performing mean coin for each smart contract platform. For example, this cycle Pepe would’ve been Ethereum and WIF for Solana.

  - We have a concentration risk policy where if anything’s not in the top 20 by market cap, we don’t allocate more than 2% of our funds AUM.
  - Only investing in blue-chip memecoins as being anything having above a $1 billion market cap.
- Murad: he only looks at meme coins that have been alive for six months and with a market cap of 5 to 200 million because he’s trying to identify cults. The community has survived 2 x 70% drops.
- idea for next cycle is to trade spot  and perp at support and resistance. Buy spot of consensus trade at support, and take out safe 3x long there too. Exit perp at resistance and sell spot as well, or short with spot.
- set a small percentage of portfolio to copy trade  pro trader(s) [https://x.com/bluntz_capital/status/1736864386973839684?s=46&t=sWjJSEmdCozIqgGnYxP7-](https://x.com/bluntz_capital/status/1736864386973839684?s=46&t=sWjJSEmdCozIqgGnYxP7- "‌")

PART 2

- Im not in crypto for yield, im in crypto for capital gains. Any crypto defi yield I can get is not worth the risk.I can get yield from tradfi. ~ Youngest crypto billionaire
- Find reputable meme coin launch companies and find a way to see who they’re in contact with. Then can follow that person on X, wait for token to drop, and buy. Or can find the contract/website in advance.
- VPN on Binance to short memes after being listed on Coinbase
- Mando buys JLP and borrows against it to play a meme coin, then takes profits back into JLP.
- MP: watching Tesla go from $160-$430 while Solana went from $200-$265 has taught me to focus on when I’ve hit 80% of the returns or more of the assets I’m currently in against the asset I want to rotate into starts moving. ￼I would have already had my goal by now.
- FOMO HOUR: Can trade AI tokens and news/attention of the day because they can 50x
- Cryptoface: If I only had to choose one indicator to trade off of to make a living it would be the VWAP on 4 H, 12 H, and Daily time frames.
- 4 Hour Timeframe:
  IA considers the 4-hour timeframe "magical" for a few reasons. It strikes a balance between providing sufficient market data to identify meaningful trends and minimizing the noise that can distort shorter timeframes, offering a clearer picture of the underlying market dynamics. The 4-hour timeframe is also versatile, suitable for various trading strategies including swing trading and day trading, allowing traders to capture intraday trends while considering broader market movements. Historical analysis and backtesting often show higher probabilities of success when using this timeframe, which allows for better identification of entry and exit points, improving the accuracy of trading signals generated by IADSS models. Additionally, the 4-hour chart is particularly effective with IA’s go to: Mean Reversion (part of IADSS).

- THINK LIKE RETAIL
  2 Not thinking like retail
  ​
  In the bull market, pumps are powered by retail. But they don't think like crypto natives. They won't care about ve(3,3) or other galaxy brain stuff.
  ​
  There are two solutions:
  ​
  First, spend time on TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube. Read the comments. To understand normies, you must spend time with normies.
  ​
  Second, focus more on pumpamentals than fundamentals. You should look for projects that:
  Can attract attention, and
  Have a simple-to-understand story. People should be able to easily explain why the future price will pump.
