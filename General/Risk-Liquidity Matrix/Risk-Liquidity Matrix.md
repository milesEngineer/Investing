# Risk-Liquidity Matrix

The Risk-Liquidity Matrix is a 4-quadrant framework designed to guide investment decisions by analyzing how Certainty vs. Uncertainty (market stability) and High vs. Low Monetary Liquidity (availability of capital) influence investor behavior and asset performance. Each quadrant describes a distinct market environment and corresponding investor response, helping to identify which assets are likely to perform best under specific conditions.

- Axes:  
  - Certainty vs. Uncertainty: High Certainty reflects stable, predictable market conditions; Low Certainty reflects volatile, unpredictable conditions.  
  - High vs. Low Monetary Liquidity: High Monetary Liquidity indicates abundant capital due to loose monetary policy; Low Monetary Liquidity indicates scarce capital due to tight policy.
- Quadrants:  
  - High Certainty, High Monetary Liquidity: Flight to Risk  Stable markets and abundant liquidity drive investors to riskier, high-return assets (e.g., growth stocks, emerging markets).
  - High Certainty, Low Monetary Liquidity: Flight to Quality  Stable markets with limited liquidity lead investors to favor high-quality, stable assets (e.g., blue-chip stocks, investment-grade bonds).
  - Low Certainty, High Monetary Liquidity: Flight to Speculation  Volatile markets with abundant liquidity encourage speculative investments in high-upside, risky assets (e.g., cryptocurrencies, small-cap stocks).
  - Low Certainty, Low Monetary Liquidity: Flight to Safety  Unstable markets and scarce liquidity push investors toward safe-haven assets (e.g., gold, government bonds) for capital preservation.

Purpose: The matrix helps investors anticipate which assets may outperform in various market conditions, balancing risk appetite with available capital.
