My Real Estate Principle Rules
Long-term Appreciation: Real estate appreciates over extended periods - pretty solid inflation hedge
Everyone needs a castle: yup
Limited downside: Real estate is a physical asset with inherent value - rarely falls
Leverage: Often buy with only 5 or 10% down :D
Tax Advantages: Property owners benefit from tax deductions if they know what they are doing.  Get paid to live.
Net net it does not need to go up as fast as BTC or TSLA
