NOTES

- Cyrpto face: Goal is 1 - 3% profit everyday
- Syndotc: First idea is to learn how it works and why price moves the way it does. Because you're never going to let it run with risk, the movements are automated with a small % of port and then you need to know which ones to add to based on your own trading knowledge. As far as making one, you need tradingview premium, an AWS cloud server or something similar, and a CEX with an API interface.
