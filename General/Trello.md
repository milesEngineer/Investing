- First time hearing about BitTensor by Barry Silbert on 4/21/25 [https://youtu.be/XoqdTfKQCjA?si=NyQTeFrme3OcNgy9](https://youtu.be/XoqdTfKQCjA?si=NyQTeFrme3OcNgy9 "smartCard-inline"), then next morning in Defi Edge email as the main topic, then rewatch B Silbert interview, then watch Bittensor doc in afternoon, then printer off BT whitepaper,
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1OJPvuvPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix1OJPvuvPs "‌") why no tao. “TAO tokenomics suck” but its the same as BTC. Doesn’t know how to say the token name. NOS trading volume is higher per IA. Commenter: 85% of TAO is staked, which is why no volume.
  - More Research: FET ($1.5 B MC, 99% tokens unlocked)
  - Ignore: AGIX/AGX (merged with FET), PAAL (on Ethereum), 0x0 (on Ethereum & 3M MC), ALI (on Ethereum & 3M MC), NFP (poor tokenomics), CTXC (why chart flat since '18, market dead - no 1 token holder of more than $100k), IQ (chart flat since '19, $91M MC), AGRS (flat since '16, $19M MC), CGPT (poor tokenomics)

Business Ideas

- Bittensor Alpha Index Fund: A token that allows for investing in the top 10% of Bittensor subnets by market cap.

[Bittensor | TGIFT | 01.10.23 | Finney Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ULRVx1LSo0 "‌")

- “The main thing for Finney was increasing Bittensors within the web3 ecoysystem. So that we could integrate into the polkadot world. So that TAO could be moved across borders.” ~Jacob
- “Subnets are running multiple Nakamoto consensus mechanisms across the same chain…. allowing us to possibly scale up to 64,000 networks.”

  Criticisms
- BT founders sold coins to investors prior to launching
  - Bittensor was funded by TAO tokens over the counter by early miners (likely founders)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ULRVx1LSo0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ULRVx1LSo0 "smartCard-inline")
  - Claims fair launch (no early investors or VC’s), but
- 600,000 TAO owned by early VCs (7% circulating supply/3% total supply)
  - VC’s/Est. Position/Est. TAO(at $577/TAO)/ % total supply:
    - [Polychain](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/18/crypto-vc-polychain-200-million-staff-shakeup/ "‌") (Olaf Carlson-Wee), $200 M, 346,620 TAO, 1.6% supply
    - [Digital Currency Group](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/02/12/digital-currency-group-barry-silbert-grayscale-genesis-fourth-quarter/ "‌") (Barry Silbert), $100 M, 173,310 TAO, 0.8% supply
    - dao5 (Tekin Salimi), $50 M, 86,655 TAO, 0.4% supply
    - TOTAL: 606,580 TAO, 2.8% total supply
    - Less than early bitcoin miners and traditional stocks, main concern is an unknown vesting schedule [https://x.com/i/grok/share/61Gkt7uBzmMf0Sq02pQk7N52Z](https://x.com/i/grok/share/61Gkt7uBzmMf0Sq02pQk7N52Z "‌")
    - Find wallets
  - Article revealing VC’s: [https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/15/bittensor-tao-polychain-digital-currency-group-dao5-ai-bitcoin/](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/15/bittensor-tao-polychain-digital-currency-group-dao5-ai-bitcoin/ "smartCard-inline")
  - “Basically you would never invest in anything.  I mean The Mag7  all have a lot of Big investors careful if they decide to dump at any time!” Youtube comment
  - Unknown Vesting Schedule & Enforacability (as no contract)
  - MP: What if Barry interviews to spread word on TAO so they can dump their tokens this year on retail to exit vesting schedule or become decentralized according to the SEC so that TAO can become a commodity like bitcoin?
  - Official Finney launch is based on 600k TAO for early VC’s
- Strong China support
  - BT built with Substrate (same thing that built out Polkadot)
    - [https://parachains.info/details/bittensor/](https://parachains.info/details/bittensor/ "smartCard-inline")
  - Most of polkadot chains are built by teams in China, [https://decrypt.co/55163/polkadot-china-hottest-crypto](https://decrypt.co/55163/polkadot-china-hottest-crypto "smartCard-inline")
  - Since BT was first interested in become a polkadot parachain, but didn’t suggests china involvement.
    - MP: Suggests the opposite because they didn’t
- Miner and validator count and stake required isn’t enforced
  - The limit of miner and validator count varies by subnet
  - The amount of TAO required for a validator to stake isn’t given only to the top 64 validators
    - Validators need to stake enough TAO to be in the top 64 but limits vary
- No lock up for staked TAO.
  - You can delegate or nominate with 0.1 TAO to earn 18% yield.
- No validators slashing TAO.
  - MP: Has anyone in bittensor ever been slashed? What is the penalty for dishonest miners?
  - The only slashing involves lowering subnets rewards.
- TAO price is high from institutional speculation not app payments
  - TAO apps are free to use
  - The only thing you can do with TAO token is delegate to subnets. EVM style contracts will increase usage of subnets. EVM will allow subnets to have frontends that generate revenue and capital to flow from other EVM chains.
  - 7200 TAO created daily
  - No obvious demand drivers
  - Low level of X followers suggests not retail speculation, but institutions, [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bittensor-rise-decentralized-ai-greythorn-asset-management-uouff](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bittensor-rise-decentralized-ai-greythorn-asset-management-uouff "smartCard-inline")
  - Institutions buy TAO because 1) military tech so must be good 2) hard to find good AI deals 3) similar to Bitcoin
  - Child hotkeys will fuel speculation based on value of subnet token. The real reason to introduce the subnet token standard is to incentivize successful subnets to remain with Bittensor
- Unknown apps and active users
  - Jacob: TAO price is proxy for subnet usage
  - Only 3 of 5 apps on BT actually work
  - No utility on Bittensor because hard for people to use and the current use cases people dont want
- Poor tokenomics
  - TAO has aggressive inflation rate, not the same as BTC
- Bittensor is built (in part) to support Bitcoin mining industry regardless of crypto market conditions
  - Founder is a “bitcoin maxi” and bitcoin miner profits falling since halving and will need additional revenue sources to keep them afloat.

  - Miners will profit from high TAO prices during bull, and profit from constant energy usage of AI during bear. While Bitcoin miners are mining at a loss.
