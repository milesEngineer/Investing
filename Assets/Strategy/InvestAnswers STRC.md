I allocated part of my cash into STRC - it is now my 6th largest position.

I may add more later.

There is risk but will monitor carefully.

Bull case: If Bitcoin stays over $100K (possible thanks to ETF inflows and money moving from money market funds), STRC’s collateral becomes stronger. That boosts and stability could attract huge amounts of traditional fixed-income capital as rates come down.

Bear case: If Bitcoin goes below $50K for a long time or a recession hits, STRC may have to cut dividends, which could push its price down to around $80–$90.

I paid $98.395
