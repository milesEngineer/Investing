# If compute for AI moves to space, how does that impact Bittensor?

Preliminary Thoughts:
- Seems negative since only centralized companies will be sending things to space.
- Implies energy on compute on earth is to expensive for training AI models and/or AI demands
- Also implies centralized AI will dominate space compute market. As companies will pay to send satellites to space. However cloud based services like AWS could still provide hosting for individual accounts.
- Bittensor mining would likely move from individuals to companies like Bitcoin as mining becomes more competitive and energy prices increase.
