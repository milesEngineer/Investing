# My Notes on The Investment Case for Bittensor by Crunch Labs '25

## Intro & Chapter 1
- p.4: "Our base case projects TAO at $4,800 by December, 2027... In our bull case, we believe TAO could climb to $10,800 in that same timeframe"
- p.4: "AI centralizes power, crypto democratizes it. AI erodes privacy, crypto protects it. AI captures value, crypto redistributes it... \[It's not about moral arguments, it's about\] superior tech and economics. Crypto-AI wins because it makes AI innovation faster and more efficient — and Bittensor is built on that understanding."
  - Maybe my take on centralized / decentralized AI is the wrong frame of reference. Maybe its only tech / economics.
- p.4: Crunch Labs has gone all in on Bittensor
- p.5: Bitcoin validated that incentives can optimize a process and a cryptoeconomic protocol can coordinate global resources
- p.5: Assumption - Centralized orgs can't compete with incentivized global contributers on a specific objective
- p.7: "Bittensor mission... build the most powerful coordination and capital allocation system for AI development"
- p.8: Community - Tensorpunks - exists because Bitcoin like fair launch and decentralized AI values
- p.8: "The OpenTensor Foundation doesn’t have a business development team, a marketing lead, or a war chest from a pre-mine to fund operations. It is intentionally lean and shrinking as the network decentralizes, with the goal of eventual dissolution."
- p.8: Contributers include Crucible Labs, Yuma, Taostats, Latent Holdings, Manifold Labs, Macrocosmos, Tensora,Covenant, GTV, Bitstarter, Stillcore and Crunch Labs
- p.9: Like Y Combinator except anyone can join.
- p.10: "creates a pure meritocracy without politics, bias, or human error"
- p.10: Like a venture portfolio. "It doesn't need every subnet to work... a few breakout successes are enough to make the entire system"
- p.11: 3 Pillar Thesis - "1. Bittensors architecture is the best environment for crypto-AI builders; 2. The smartest AI developers in the world will keep showing up to mine subnets; 3. Subnet successes will compound, creating network effects that pull the best building into Bittensor"
- p.11: "AI needs a consensus mechanism that can work with its probabilistic outputs and its heavy compute requirements. Bittensor solved this with YumaConsensus."
- p.12: Bittensor has become an "aggregator of specialized intelligence on the supply side."
- p.13: Bittensor is a positive sum, not zero sum, game because as one subnet does well the whole ecosystem benefits through increased demand for TAO / alpha token rise in value, miner quality improves due increase in reward pool, and ambitious projects become viable to fund capital intensive experiements.
- p.13: One subnet success compounds across the network.
- p.13: "We’rewatching two metrics:the numbers of both quality Subnet founders and miners joining. If those keep trending up and to the right, the investment thesis for Bittensor remains strong."

## Chapter 2
- p.16: "Any measurable service or task that can be rewarded based on performance can be codified as a Subnet." Doesn't have to be AI related.
- p.16: "All that’s required is an incentive mechanism. Bitennsor handles the rest:" tokenomics, DEX's, and no blockchain specific infrastructure.
  - In practice, I believe its more complicated. Creating a subnet is like a start up as mentioned earlier. Founders, teams and capital need assembling to pay for compensation, bittensor subnet registration (currently ~$100k), and any related infratruction like hosting or services. Additionally the team needs to recruit and work with early validators and miners, which are usually other companies. So they must evaluate and commit their resources or hire more talent to fulfill validator or miner duties. Also I think subnets still need approval by Opentensor Foundation, which means its still gated. 
- p.16: Currently 128 subnet cap, but expected to increase and eventually be infinite over time.
- p.16: "When a new team wants to launch, the lowest performing Subnet is deregistered. This creates constant
competition not only to avoid the bottom, but to climb the top of the leaderboard, since higher-ranked Subnets earn a larger share of TAO emissions."
- p.16: "Each Subnet contains its own decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented as an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pool. When Bittensor distributes emissions, it does so by injecting TAO into one side of the pool and an equalizing amount of Subnet tokens into the other side, maintaining pool balance. These pools serve as the primary venue for contributors to convert their Subnet tokens back into TAO, and for investors to gain exposure to Subnet tokens. The protocol then observes net trading volume into each Subnet’s AMM pools and uses those signals to determine how TAO emissions should be allocated across Subnets. Ultimately, Subnets with stronger market interest receive more TAO emissions, while the Subnet with the lowest market interest is automatically removed when a new Subnet registers."
- p.17: Crunch Labs subnet categories: compute / infrastructure, robotics, desci, defi, data pipeline, decentralized training, predictive systems, model / agent development, and misc
- p.18: Open source is the best way to build frontier tech because open-collaboration. "Closed systems in the long-run, no matter how well-resourced, can’t coordinate enough expertise at the speed and scale required at the frontier." Previous sucessful examples TCP/IP, DNS, Linux, PyTorch, Tensorflow. Open-source gives speed, reach, and best industry minds.
- p.18: Open-source has failed as startup model because " (1) startups need to capture value to survive and (2) contributors need a path to upside, which open-source has previously never offered."
- p.18: "Subnets = Open-Source Start-Ups"
- p.18: Two subnet types: coordinate a distributed workforce and coordinate digital resources.
- p.19: "The founder designs one thing: an incentive mechanism that rewards whoever produces the top-performing agent." With the right incentives, "Domain experts can show up, plug in, and get paid. No
interviews, no coding tests, no performance reviews."
- p.19: "When rate of innovation is the only moat that matters, open participation becomes the ultimate advantage."
  - Bittensor subnets make obvious what nature has always programmed, survival of the most adaptable.
- Maybe centralized compute providers will join a Bittensor subnet to provide compute
- p.20: "Compute flows dynamically to its highest-value use, directed by the market. As more compute owners look to monetize idle capacity the way energy producers monetize excess power, the need for a liquid, on-demand marketplace becomes obvious. And Bittensor can support it."
- p.21: "emissions are split across contributors:18% to the Subnet Owner, 41% to miners,
and 41% to validators."
  - Subnet owners can reduce their 18% take to increase the emissions evenly split between miners and validators. https://docs.learnbittensor.org/subnets/understanding-multiple-mech-subnets
- p.21: "The goal for every Subnet is to eventually become sustainable, meaning to generate enough value and attract enough demand that emissions are no longer the main source of funding."
- What if digital resource subnets is like electricity overflow providers? Centralized companies use their own compute as the baseline like nuclear and coal, but excess required compute is used by solar. Chutes would likely be the first use case of this scenario.
- p.30: "the network depends on having both revenue-generating teams and high-risk research efforts."
  - How do measure, track or view general trends of revenue generating subnets?
- p.30: "Google’s 70/20/10 rule offers a useful analogy. Most of its resources went toward advancing the core business, some toward adjacent opportunities, and a smaller share toward high-risk innovation. We think Bittensor’s ecosystem should follow a similar pattern. Roughly 70 percent of Subnets should focus on becoming cash-flow positive—earning more revenue than they spend on miner emissions—while the remaining 30 percent can pursue high-risk, high-reward research. The revenue-generating Subnets effectively subsidize the research Subnets, creating a balanced, self-funding ecosystem."
  - Great idea, but in practice not sure if this is an organic or coordinated outcome.
