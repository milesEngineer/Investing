# My Notes on The Investment Case for Bittensor by Crunch Labs '25

## Intro & Chapter 1
- p.4: "Our base case projects TAO at $4,800 by December, 2027... In our bull case, we believe TAO could climb to $10,800 in that same timeframe"
- p.4: "AI centralizes power, crypto democratizes it. AI erodes privacy, crypto protects it. AI captures value, crypto redistributes it... \[It's not about moral arguments, it's about\] superior tech and economics. Crypto-AI wins because it makes AI innovation faster and more efficient — and Bittensor is built on that understanding."
  - Maybe my take on centralized / decentralized AI is the wrong frame of reference. Maybe its only tech / economics.
- p.4: Crunch Labs has gone all in on Bittensor
- p.5: Bitcoin validated that incentives can optimize a process and a cryptoeconomic protocol can coordinate global resources
- p.5: Assumption - Centralized orgs can't compete with incentivized global contributers on a specific objective
- p.7: "Bittensor mission... build the most powerful coordination and capital allocation system for AI development"
- p.8: Community - Tensorpunks - exists because Bitcoin like fair launch and decentralized AI values
- p.8: "The OpenTensor Foundation doesn’t have a business development team, a marketing lead, or a war chest from a pre-mine to fund operations. It is intentionally lean and shrinking as the network decentralizes, with the goal of eventual dissolution."
- p.8: Contributers include Crucible Labs, Yuma, Taostats, Latent Holdings, Manifold Labs, Macrocosmos, Tensora,Covenant, GTV, Bitstarter, Stillcore and Crunch Labs
- p.9: Like Y Combinator except anyone can join.
- p.10: "creates a pure meritocracy without politics, bias, or human error"
- p.10: Like a venture portfolio. "It doesn't need every subnet to work... a few breakout successes are enough to make the entire system"
- p.11: 3 Pillar Thesis - "1. Bittensors architecture is the best environment for crypto-AI builders; 2. The smartest AI developers in the world will keep showing up to mine subnets; 3. Subnet successes will compound, creating network effects that pull the best building into Bittensor"
- p.11: "AI needs a consensus mechanism that can work with its probabilistic outputs and its heavy compute requirements. Bittensor solved this with YumaConsensus."
- p.12: Bittensor has become an "aggregator of specialized intelligence on the supply side."
- p.13: Bittensor is a positive sum, not zero sum, game because as one subnet does well the whole ecosystem benefits through increased demand for TAO / alpha token rise in value, miner quality improves due increase in reward pool, and ambitious projects become viable to fund capital intensive experiements.
- p.13: One subnet success compounds across the network.
- p.13: "We’rewatching two metrics:the numbers of both quality Subnet founders and miners joining. If those keep trending up and to the right, the investment thesis for Bittensor remains strong."
