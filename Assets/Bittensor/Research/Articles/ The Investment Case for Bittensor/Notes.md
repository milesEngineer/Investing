# My Notes on The Investment Case for Bittensor by Crunch Labs '25

## Intro & Chapter 1
- p.4: "Our base case projects TAO at $4,800 by December, 2027... In our bull case, we believe TAO could climb to $10,800 in that same timeframe"
- p.4: "AI centralizes power, crypto democratizes it. AI erodes privacy, crypto protects it. AI captures value, crypto redistributes it... \[It's not about moral arguments, it's about\] superior tech and economics. Crypto-AI wins because it makes AI innovation faster and more efficient — and Bittensor is built on that understanding."
  - Maybe my take on centralized / decentralized AI is the wrong frame of reference. Maybe its only tech / economics.
- p.4: Crunch Labs has gone all in on Bittensor
- p.5: Bitcoin validated that incentives can optimize a process and a cryptoeconomic protocol can coordinate global resources
- p.5: Assumption - Centralized orgs can't compete with incentivized global contributers on a specific objective
- p.7: "Bittensor mission... build the most powerful coordination and capital allocation system for AI development"
- p.8: Community - Tensorpunks - exists because Bitcoin like fair launch and decentralized AI values
- p.8: "The OpenTensor Foundation doesn’t have a business development team, a marketing lead, or a war chest from a pre-mine to fund operations. It is intentionally lean and shrinking as the network decentralizes, with the goal of eventual dissolution."
- p.8: Contributers include Crucible Labs, Yuma, Taostats, Latent Holdings, Manifold Labs, Macrocosmos, Tensora,Covenant, GTV, Bitstarter, Stillcore and Crunch Labs
- p.9: Like Y Combinator except anyone can join.
- p.10: "creates a pure meritocracy without politics, bias, or human error"
- p.10: Like a venture portfolio. "It doesn't need every subnet to work... a few breakout successes are enough to make the entire system"
- p.11: 3 Pillar Thesis - "1. Bittensors architecture is the best environment for crypto-AI builders; 2. The smartest AI developers in the world will keep showing up to mine subnets; 3. Subnet successes will compound, creating network effects that pull the best building into Bittensor"
- p.11: "AI needs a consensus mechanism that can work with its probabilistic outputs and its heavy compute requirements. Bittensor solved this with YumaConsensus."
- p.12: Bittensor has become an "aggregator of specialized intelligence on the supply side."
- p.13: Bittensor is a positive sum, not zero sum, game because as one subnet does well the whole ecosystem benefits through increased demand for TAO / alpha token rise in value, miner quality improves due increase in reward pool, and ambitious projects become viable to fund capital intensive experiements.
- p.13: One subnet success compounds across the network.
- p.13: "We’rewatching two metrics:the numbers of both quality Subnet founders and miners joining. If those keep trending up and to the right, the investment thesis for Bittensor remains strong."

## Chapter 2
- p.16: "Any measurable service or task that can be rewarded based on performance can be codified as a Subnet." Doesn't have to be AI related.
- p.16: "All that’s required is an incentive mechanism. Bitennsor handles the rest:" tokenomics, DEX's, and no blockchain specific infrastructure.
  - In practice, I believe its more complicated. Creating a subnet is like a start up as mentioned earlier. Founders, teams and capital need assembling to pay for compensation, bittensor subnet registration (currently ~$100k), and any related infratruction like hosting or services. Additionally the team needs to recruit and work with early validators and miners, which are usually other companies. So they must evaluate and commit their resources or hire more talent to fulfill validator or miner duties. Also I think subnets still need approval by Opentensor Foundation, which means its still gated. 
- p.16: Currently 128 subnet cap, but expected to increase and eventually be infinite over time.
- p.16: "When a new team wants to launch, the lowest performing Subnet is deregistered. This creates constant
competition not only to avoid the bottom, but to climb the top of the leaderboard, since higher-ranked Subnets earn a larger share of TAO emissions."
- p.16: "Each Subnet contains its own decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented as an automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pool. When Bittensor distributes emissions, it does so by injecting TAO into one side of the pool and an equalizing amount of Subnet tokens into the other side, maintaining pool balance. These pools serve as the primary venue for contributors to convert their Subnet tokens back into TAO, and for investors to gain exposure to Subnet tokens. The protocol then observes net trading volume into each Subnet’s AMM pools and uses those signals to determine how TAO emissions should be allocated across Subnets. Ultimately, Subnets with stronger market interest receive more TAO emissions, while the Subnet with the lowest market interest is automatically removed when a new Subnet registers."
- p.17: Crunch Labs subnet categories: compute / infrastructure, robotics, desci, defi, data pipeline, decentralized training, predictive systems, model / agent development, and misc
- p.18: Open source is the best way to build frontier tech because open-collaboration. "Closed systems in the long-run, no matter how well-resourced, can’t coordinate enough expertise at the speed and scale required at the frontier." Previous sucessful examples TCP/IP, DNS, Linux, PyTorch, Tensorflow. Open-source gives speed, reach, and best industry minds.
- p.18: Open-source has failed as startup model because " (1) startups need to capture value to survive and (2) contributors need a path to upside, which open-source has previously never offered."
- p.18: "Subnets = Open-Source Start-Ups"
- p.18: Two subnet types: coordinate a distributed workforce and coordinate digital resources.
- p.19: "The founder designs one thing: an incentive mechanism that rewards whoever produces the top-performing agent." With the right incentives, "Domain experts can show up, plug in, and get paid. No
interviews, no coding tests, no performance reviews."
- p.19: "When rate of innovation is the only moat that matters, open participation becomes the ultimate advantage."
  - Bittensor subnets make obvious what nature has always programmed, survival of the most adaptable.
- Maybe centralized compute providers will join a Bittensor subnet to provide compute
- p.20: "Compute flows dynamically to its highest-value use, directed by the market. As more compute owners look to monetize idle capacity the way energy producers monetize excess power, the need for a liquid, on-demand marketplace becomes obvious. And Bittensor can support it."
- p.21: "emissions are split across contributors:18% to the Subnet Owner, 41% to miners,
and 41% to validators."
  - Subnet owners can reduce their 18% take to increase the emissions evenly split between miners and validators. https://docs.learnbittensor.org/subnets/understanding-multiple-mech-subnets
- p.21: "The goal for every Subnet is to eventually become sustainable, meaning to generate enough value and attract enough demand that emissions are no longer the main source of funding."
- What if digital resource subnets is like electricity overflow providers? Centralized companies use their own compute as the baseline like nuclear and coal, but excess required compute is used by solar. Chutes would likely be the first use case of this scenario.
- p.30: "the network depends on having both revenue-generating teams and high-risk research efforts."
  - How do measure, track or view general trends of revenue generating subnets?
- p.30: "Google’s 70/20/10 rule offers a useful analogy. Most of its resources went toward advancing the core business, some toward adjacent opportunities, and a smaller share toward high-risk innovation. We think Bittensor’s ecosystem should follow a similar pattern. Roughly 70 percent of Subnets should focus on becoming cash-flow positive—earning more revenue than they spend on miner emissions—while the remaining 30 percent can pursue high-risk, high-reward research. The revenue-generating Subnets effectively subsidize the research Subnets, creating a balanced, self-funding ecosystem."
  - Great idea, but in practice not sure if this is an organic or coordinated outcome.

## Chapter 3
- p.32: "Revenue driven buybacks strengthen miner incentives, which leads to better outputs, which makes the product easier to monetize. When buybacks exceed emissions, supply contracts and the token becomes deflationary. This deflation drives the flywheel that makes Subnet economics durable: higher prices strengthen miner incentives, attracting more talent and better performance."
- p.32: "Virtuous cycle compounds value for all actors:The subnet owner structures an incentive mechanism for the miners. 2. Miners compete with one another based on the IM to maximize their token rewards. 3. The subnet owner takes the miners resources and packages them into a product or servvice to monetize. 4. Revenue distributed back into the token attracts more miners and increases competition. 5. Miners reinvest their gains, futher optimizing their outputs for the subnet owner."
- p.33: "That means the two most important drivers for aSubnet are: 1. Revenue potential – The team’s ability to monetize miner outputs, the pace of revenue growth, and the scale of the market they’re targeting. 2. Capital efficiency – How efficiently the Subnet generates revenue relative to miner emission costs... Each Subnet becomes its own economic system with its own demand profile and risk-return characteristics"
- p.34: "While Subnet token emissions are roughly twice as fast as Bitcoin’s and there are variables that make exact forecasts difficult... we expect new Subnets to follow roughly this schedule: ~18% (3.7M) by month 12; and ~36% (7.5M) by month 24"
- p.34 "This level of predictability makes headline FDV unnecessary as a valuation anchor. Instead, valuations should be tied to an investor’s time horizon and the projected circulating supply at that point. Using that supply estimate, the FDV can be discounted accordingly. For example, if 36% of the supply is expected to be circulating, the appropriate discount is 64%."
- p.35 - 36: lists annual revenues of subnets - chutes $5.8M, ridges speculative revenue projection, targon $10M, and Lium $5.3M.
- p.37: "TAO liquidity in a Uniswap-style AMM pool"
- p.37: "The Fat Stack Thesis. Rather than choosing between protocol or application, Bittensor's architecture captures value from both, simultaneously. When Subnets grow, they attribute higher value to TAO as the sole liquidity provider. When the Bittensor protocol grows, TAO gives Subnets and their miners even greater incentives. This symbiotic relationship, enforced by Bittensor’s enshrinedDEX that fixes Subnet token liquidity to TAO, defines the Fat Stack Thesis."
- p.38: "This isn't the case with L1s like Ethereum or Solana, where applications routinely extract value from the L1rails and return less by circumventing base transaction fees and using alternative currencies (e.g. stablecoins) for liquidity. TAO functions as an index fund, explicitly tied to the collective value of its Subnets which can only be denominated in TAO."
- p.38 - 39: Crunch Labs uses a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) methodology to value top subnets 5% to project the aggrgate market cap of the subnet ecosystem. They expect the top 5% to equal 80% of the total network value.
- p.39: "Solana trades ~200x multiple to protocol fees. The premium is an underlying trust in the network and the asset as a non-sovereign store of value."
- p.40: "In the bear case, we forecast a scenario where centralized AI gets so deeply embedded in the digital fabric of our lives that alternative products, even with higher performance, are slow to gain adoption. Passive users are satisfied by ‘good enough’ products, and inertia effectively outweighs the benefits of something technically superior. In this environment, traditional AI startups also face pressure. Our bear case models the shift to open-source competition taking much longer than anticipated, with TAO potentially trading at $663 in 2027."
  - What might this - centralized AI deeply embedded satisfing users with good enough - to prevent them from using Bittensor subnets? So that I can consider pivoting if Bittensor becomes more like an open-source competition.
- p.43: Emission Distribution Change implemented in Nov 2025 "Subnets must now demonstrate positive net flows to receive emissions, effectively requiring real economic activity rather than speculative interest to create demand for their tokens."
- p.43: "There are simply no serious contenders attempting what Bittensor has already proven at scale. And if a new one does emerge, it will face a structural disadvantage from day one, because
it would need to replicate Bittensor’s fair launch, one of its greatest moats. Pulling off a true fair launch today is nearly impossible. They only work when a project begins quietly and allows supply, community, and price to form organically over time... By traditional venture math, one in thirty makes the fund. Applied here, four or five successful Subnets could make Bittensor a generational success...  TAO at current levels represents the kind of structural mispricing that may define generational investment opportunities."
