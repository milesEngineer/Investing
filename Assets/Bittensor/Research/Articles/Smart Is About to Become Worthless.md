“We got to say that kind of out loud. Intelligence is about to be a commodity.”

When Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the man currently powering the global AI revolution, stood before students at Cambridge University, he didn’t talk about coding faster or studying harder.

He dropped a bomb on the modern education system.

For decades, society has sold us a specific formula for success: High IQ + Perfect Test Scores + Specialized Knowledge = A Secure Future. We hire the “smartest” people. We obsess over grades. We treat intelligence as a scarce, gold-standard resource.

But Huang is telling us that the era is over.

As AI rises, it doesn’t just compete with us; it laps us. It can score 100% on the test faster than you can pick up your pencil. It can write cleaner code, diagnose diseases, and summarize legal briefs in seconds.

In the very near future, raw intelligence will be like tap water or electricity: vital, yes, but cheap, abundant, and accessible to everyone with a Wi-Fi connection.

This was a hard-hitting but interesting piece, but it is also on the money.

Intelligence is becoming a commodity: AI will make raw smarts abundant and cheap, like electricity, ending the era where high IQ alone guarantees success. Standardized tasks like coding or summarizing will be AI's domain, but vague, chaotic problems requiring judgment remain human territory.

The new superpower is the ability to separate the signal from the noise, choose what matters, and make intuitive decisions from infinite options. As I have been saying for years... teach your kids to ask the right Q's because AI has all the answers... well Jensen just said pretty much the same thing... "Stop competing on memorization; focus on asking right questions"

# My Thoughts
- What does it mean for Bitenssor in the age of AI for intelligence to become a commodity? Bittensor is accelerating open source intelligence with niche or specialized intelligence commodities.
- If intelligence is commoditized, then Bittensor thesis is validated.
