- p.4: "Treasury Strategy: Use cash to increase shareholders’ per-share exposure to HYPE in the most efficient way possible"
  - What is their actual strategy to increasure pre-share exposure? GPT: share buyback program (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/08/3201605/0/en/Hyperliquid-Strategies-Inc-Announces-30-million-Stock-Repurchase-Program.html) (or ~10% cash holdings at the time), raise $1B via equity offerings (already done via co acquisition), and staking (~2.5% HYPE APY). I would guess 80-90% of of increasing per-share exposure is buying HYPE tokens.

-p.13: HyperEVM smart contract allows apps to be built on the blockchain.
  - If apps are becoming irrelant due to AI agents, how does this impact hyperEVM and HYPE token? Value moves from front-end UI to backend execution layer. Agents prefer deterministic, deep, low-friction venues not pretty apps. Volume may increase if bots adopt HL for trading. Only bearish if agents treat all execution venues as interchangeable liqidity pipes, then chains compete purely on cost, latency, and reliability.

The average on-chain market capitalization during Q3 2025 was ~$1.2T, implying an overall “market cap. to annualized fees” ratio of ~58x... Hypes was ~11x. These differences in valuation metrics are reflected in Hyperliquid’s share of onchain market cap. (~1.1%) versus its share of on-chain fees (~5.8%)"
