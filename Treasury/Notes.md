- 06/20/25: On a walk in the woods, I realized a few things. 
  - My default is a Bittensor Treasury company owned by a trust to protect against being doxed.
  - My default is to raise debt and setup the company to have the option to issue equity to allow for future potential.
  - My default is to not issue equity because if I believe Bittensor is going to $100k in 10 years, which would be $1 Billion for 10,000 TAO, then thats plenty of money for myself and my family. Plus I will have gained that time back as opposed to sales and social media prescence. 
  - Michael Saylor said every big idea in the 21st century is going from analog to digital. Bittensor is physical intelligence to digital intelligence, decentralized.
  - If we're living in a simulation, it's plausible that advanced humans or ai is running parallel simulations to determine threats in real time in order to make the highest probable choice.
